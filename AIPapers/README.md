- Bridges the gap between success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning
- Introduces new class of CNNs called **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANS)**
- Shows that deep convolutional adversarial pair (generator and discriminator) learns hierarchy of 
representations from object parts to scenes in both generator and discriminator
- Additionally, uses learned features for novel tasks
	- Demonstrates DCGANs' applicability as general image representations
- Play around with implementation [here](notebooks/DCGANs.ipynb)

## [Stacked Capsule Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.06818.pdf)

## [Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf)

## [Generalized Ternary Connect: End-to-End Learning and Compression of Multiplication-Free Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04985)
- Seems to involve restricting the weights of a neural network to powers of 2 such that no multiplications are necessary. This is done instead of the more typical binarization of weights.
